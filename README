Put together for a presentation I'm doing on CincyPy titled
"Optimizing Python".

It's meant to showcase the wide variety of choice that we 
have in making python faster...

Check out benchmark.py for hints on how to run everything.

Sorry for sparse documentation, hopefully more to come.

This does not include all options. SwiG is not included,
and I couldn't get berp or shedskin to work properly. 
Also unladen swallow is acting up on my install, not
sure why.
